      When adding logging statements:

      1. Use structured logging with key-value pairs
      2. Choose appropriate log levels:
         - DEBUG: Detailed information, typically for troubleshooting
         - INFO: General information about program operation
         - WARNING: Something unexpected but not an error
         - ERROR: Something failed but operation can continue
         - CRITICAL: Something failed and operation cannot continue
      3. Include relevant context in log messages
      4. Use consistent naming for log keys
      5. Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)

      Examples:
      ```python
      # Good:
      logger.info("Processing zone data", 
                 zone_id=zone.id, 
                 building_id=zone.building_id,
                 num_devices=len(zone.devices))

      # Bad:
      logger.info(f"Processing zone {zone.id} in building {zone.building_id} with {len(zone.devices)} devices")
      ```

  - type: lint
    conditions:
      - pattern: "(?:logger|log)\\.(debug|info|warning|error|critical)\\(f?\"[^\"]*{[^}]*}[^\"]*\"\\)"
        message: "Use structured logging with key-value pairs instead of f-strings"

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Using f-strings in logging
      logger.info(f"Processing zone {zone.id} in building {zone.building_id} with {len(zone.devices)} devices")
      
      # Good: Using structured logging
      logger.info("Processing zone data", 
                 zone_id=zone.id, 
                 building_id=zone.building_id,
                 num_devices=len(zone.devices))
    output: "Logging statement with proper structured format"
