## Implementation Status

### Repository Migration Configuration
- Source Organization: Bitbucket (`zyncup`)
- Target Organization: GitHub (`degree-analytics`)
- Migration Tool: `create-github-repo.sh`

### facility_api Repository

   - Commit history matches source
   - Repository size consistent

2. Security & Access
   - Branch protection enabled
     * Requires 1 PR review

### Next Repository: normalized_integration_lambda
- Status: Migration In Progress
- Priority: High (Last active: 2024-08-19)
- Migration Started: March 24, 2025 19:32:11 CDT
- Initial Validation Status: Failed (March 24, 2025 18:42:29 CDT)
- Last Update: March 24, 2025 19:32:11 CDT
- Repository URL: https://github.com/degree-analytics/normalized_integration_lambda

#### Migration Strategy Update
- Simplified approach adopted:
  1. Direct mirror clone from Bitbucket
  2. Push all content to GitHub
  3. Convert master to main branch
  4. Set up branch protection and team access
  - ❌ NO template repository usage
  - ❌ NO copying of additional files
  - ✓ Preserve all original content and history

#### Required Fixes
1. Script Updates (`create-github-repo.sh`):
   ```bash
   # Push Repository Function
   - Use git clone --mirror for complete history
   - Push directly to GitHub with --mirror
   - Handle master to main conversion after push
   - Set up branch protection for main branch
   ```

#### Next Actions (Updated: 2025-03-24 19:32:11 CDT)
1. Delete current GitHub repository
2. Re-run migration with simplified mirror approach
3. Run comprehensive validation
4. Document results in updates.md

## Migration Progress
- Total Repositories: 19
- Successfully Migrated: 2
- Validation Passed: 2
- Pending: 17
- Failed: 0 (1 in retry)

## Next Steps
1. Fix migration script issues
2. Retry normalized_integration_lambda migration
