3. Repository archival will be handled in Phase 4

## Progress History

### 2025-03-24 14:21:44 CDT - Organization Setup Complete
- ‚úÖ Organization settings configured:
  - Repository creation restricted to admins
  - GitHub Pages disabled for members
  - Web commit signoff required
  - Security features enabled:
    - Dependabot alerts
    - Secret scanning
    - Dependency graph
  - Teams configured:
    - Engineering team verified

### 2025-03-24 14:23:28 CDT - Migration Preparation
- üìã Status Update:
  - Organization setup verified and complete

# Status Updates: Repository Migration
Last Updated: 2025-03-24 18:42:29 CDT

## Latest Status

### Validation Failures for normalized_integration_lambda

#### 1. Branch Migration Issues
- ‚ùå Branch verification failed
  - GitHub only has `main` branch
  - Missing branches from Bitbucket:
    * `dev`
    * `migration`
    * `working`
  - Root cause: `push_repository` function not pushing all branches correctly

#### 2. GitHub Actions
- ‚ùå Workflows missing
  - No workflow files present in GitHub repository
  - Root cause: Workflow files not being copied/pushed from source

### Required Script Fixes

1. `create-github-repo.sh`:
   ```bash
   # Current push_repository function issues:
   - Not using --mirror or --all when pushing
   - Not handling branch renames properly
   - Not verifying all branches after push
   ```

2. Missing Functionality:
   ```bash
   - No workflow file copying
   - No branch verification after push
   - No retry mechanism for failed pushes
   ```

### Next Actions
1. Fix `push_repository` function to:
   - Use `git push --mirror` for complete repository copy
   - Add branch verification step
   - Add retry mechanism for failed pushes

2. Add workflow handling:
   - Copy workflow files from source
   - Verify workflow presence after push

3. Update validation script to:
   - Add detailed branch comparison
   - Add workflow file verification
   - Improve error reporting

### Working Components
1. Repository Creation:
   - ‚úì Working correctly
   - ‚úì Private repository setting correct
   - ‚úì Basic settings configured

2. Branch Protection:
   - ‚úì Rules applied correctly
   - ‚úì PR reviews required
   - ‚úì Status checks enabled

3. Team Access:
   - ‚úì Permissions set correctly
   - ‚úì Engineering team access working
   - ! QA team pending (expected)
