- Verified setenv.sh script configuration:
  - Contains all required environment variables
  - Includes test coverage configuration
  - Properly sets up Python paths
  - Configures service secrets
- Verified docker-compose.yml:
  - PostgreSQL 13 configuration matches environment
  - Redis 7 with correct port mapping (6380)
  - LocalStack 3 with required services
  - All services have health checks configured

### Findings:
1. Environment Setup:
   - setenv.sh is properly configured with all necessary variables
   - Coverage settings are present (TEST_COVERAGE, COVERAGE_REPORT_DIR, COVERAGE_FAIL_UNDER)
   - Service secrets are properly formatted as JSON strings
   - Debug mode available for troubleshooting

2. Docker Configuration:
   - All required services present (postgres, redis, localstack)
   - Port mappings match environment variables
   - Health checks configured for all services
   - Service versions are consistent with requirements

### Next Steps:
1. Run Docker containers and verify health checks:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose ps  # Verify all services are healthy
   ```
2. Source environment variables:
   ```bash
   source setenv.sh
   ```
3. Test service connectivity:
   - PostgreSQL on port 5432
   - Redis on port 6380
   - LocalStack on port 4566

## 2025-04-01 17:20:15 CDT - Docker Configuration Approach Clarified

### Actions Taken:
- Removed references to specific service versions (PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7, etc.)
- Clarified that existing docker-compose.yml will be used without modifications
- Updated implementation strategy to maintain service consistency

### Findings:
1. Docker Configuration:
   - No need to modify existing docker-compose.yml
   - Services already properly configured for testing
   - Consistency with existing repositories is priority
   - Avoids unnecessary version changes or complexity

2. Benefits:
   - Simpler implementation with fewer changes

3. Proceed with test_runner.sh enhancement

## 2025-04-01 17:15:20 CDT - Implementation Approach Revised

### Actions Taken:
- Restructured implementation plan to prioritize local testing
- Moved GitHub integration and deploy key setup to later tasks
- Refocused initial efforts on Docker environment and test runner

### Findings:
1. Implementation Sequence:
   - Original plan started with GitHub deploy key setup
   - More practical to get local environment working first
   - Ensures functionality before CI/CD integration

2. Priority Changes:
   - First: Local environment with Docker containers
   - Second: Test runner enhancement with coverage
   - Third: Local development tools (linting, pre-commit)
   - Fourth: GitHub integration (deploy keys, Actions)
   - Fifth: Documentation and verification

3. Benefits:
   - More iterative approach with earlier validation
   - Faster local development setup
   - Easier troubleshooting without CI complexity
   - Clear separation between local and CI concerns

### Next Steps:
1. Verify setenv.sh script functionality
2. Configure Docker containers properly
3. Enhance test_runner.sh with coverage support
4. Test submodule initialization locally

### Actions Taken:
- Updated memory-management.mdc rule to include project-plan.md guidelines
- Restructured project-plan.md to be concise and chronological
- Created repository-setup.md to preserve detailed guidelines
- Updated references in phase-7 plan.md to point to new documentation

### Findings:
1. Documentation Structure:
   - Project plan had become unwieldy with redundant sections
   - Memory management rule lacked specific guidance for project-plan.md
   - Important information needed preservation in dedicated documents

2. Improvements Made:
   - Added explicit guidelines for project-plan.md in memory management rule
   - Restructured project-plan.md as chronological phase list
   - Created comprehensive repository-setup.md for detailed guidelines
   - Ensured no information loss during restructuring

3. Next Steps:
   - Verify all internal documentation references
   - Ensure all phase summary documents are complete
   - Use new project-plan.md structure for future updates

- Updated project-plan.md with Phase 7 information

### Findings:
1. Repository Structure:
   - .gitmodules now correctly points to GitHub URLs
