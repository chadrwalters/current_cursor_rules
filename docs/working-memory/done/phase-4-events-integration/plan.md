6. Revisit Pending Tasks:
   - Return to Phase 4.C: GitHub CI/CD Setup (currently on hold)
   - Return to Phase 4.D: Documentation and Standardization (currently on hold)
   - Complete branch protection configuration

## Dependencies
- GitHub Actions runner environment
- SSH deploy keys for both repositories
- Service container configurations

## Collaboration Approach

To effectively work across both repositories (events and ci-templates), we'll use the following approach:

1. **Multi-Root Workspace**: 
   - Add both repositories to the same Cursor workspace
   - This allows simultaneous access to files in both repositories
   - AI context will include both repositories for better assistance

2. **Repository Structure**:
   - `ci-templates/`: Main repository for template files and documentation
     - `.github/workflows/`: Template workflow files
     - `scripts/`: Helper scripts and utilities
     - `actions/`: Example composite actions
     - `docs/`: Documentation of patterns and usage
   - `events/`: Main application repository
     - Will implement templates from ci-templates repository
     - Test environment for validating templates

3. **Workflow**:
   - Development primarily in ci-templates repository
   - Testing and validation in events repository
   - Documentation updates in both repositories as appropriate
   - Separate Git histories and commits for each repository

4. **Knowledge Transfer**:
   - Regular updates to both plan files
   - Cross-repository documentation references
   - Common patterns documented in ci-templates for future use

This approach maintains proper separation between repositories while enabling efficient collaborative work across both codebases.

## Notes
- Implementing a hybrid approach with standardized templates instead of full reusable workflows
- This approach allows greater flexibility while still standardizing common patterns
- We can transition to reusable workflows after migrating more repositories and learning more patterns
- This will still resolve previous SSH and submodule issues by standardizing the approach

## Implementation Timeline

- Phase 4.A: 3 days ‚úÖ
- Phase 4.B: 2 days ‚úÖ
- Phase 4.C: 2 days ‚è∏ (on hold while implementing Phase 4.E)
- Phase 4.D: 1 day ‚è∏ (on hold while implementing Phase 4.E)

  - Task 4.E.3: Completed ‚úÖ (1 day)
  - Task 4.E.4: Completed ‚úÖ (1-2 days remaining)
  - Task 4.E.5: Completed ‚úÖ (1 day)

Total estimated time remaining: 2-3 days

## Success Criteria

1. All tests run successfully in local development environment
2. GitHub Actions workflow runs tests successfully
3. Coverage reporting is implemented and baseline established
4. Documentation is complete and accessible
5. Developers can easily set up and run tests locally
6. Standardized templates implemented and working for events repository
7. Clear patterns documented for extending to other repositories

## Key Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| PostgreSQL timezone case sensitivity | Ensure TZ=UTC in .env file and pass properly to Docker containers |
| Test isolation | Ensure proper container lifecycle management in test runner |
| CI/CD configuration | Follow pattern established in Phases 2 and 3 |
| Working with dependencies | Use environment variables instead of code modifications |
