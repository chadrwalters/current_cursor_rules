**Created**: 2025-03-30 21:02:37 UTC  
**Status**: Draft  
**Author**: Chad Walters  
**Version**: 1.0

This checklist provides a comprehensive guide for implementing CI/CD workflows in new repositories, based on learnings from the events repository integration. Follow these steps in sequence to ensure a successful implementation.

## 1. Repository Configuration

- [ ] **SSH Authentication**
  - [ ] Generate a new SSH key pair for repository access
  - [ ] Add public key as deploy key to repository with read access
  - [ ] Store private key as secret in GitHub repository settings
  - [ ] If submodules are used, repeat for each submodule repository
  - [ ] Use meaningful names for secrets (e.g., REPO_NAME_DEPLOY_KEY)

- [ ] **Branch Protection**
  - [ ] Configure branch protection for main branch
  - [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging
  - [ ] Require pull request reviews
  - [ ] Enforce linear history if needed

- [ ] **Repository Settings**
  - [ ] Enable rebase merging
  - [ ] Enable automatic branch deletion on merge
  - [ ] Configure CODEOWNERS file if needed

## 2. Workflow Implementation

- [ ] **Basic Workflow Structure**
  - [ ] Copy the appropriate template from ci-templates repository
  - [ ] Configure appropriate triggers (PRs to main, push to main)
  - [ ] Remove any irrelevant workflow components

- [ ] **SSH Setup**
  - [ ] Configure SSH before repository checkout
  - [ ] Add GitHub to known hosts via ssh-keyscan
  - [ ] Use SSH URLs for all GitHub operations (including checkout)
  - [ ] Add debug steps for SSH verification

- [ ] **Submodule Handling**
  - [ ] Configure Git to use SSH for submodules
  - [ ] Initialize and update submodules manually
  - [ ] Add verification steps for submodule access
  - [ ] Add debug information for submodule status

- [ ] **Service Containers**
  - [ ] Configure required service containers (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
  - [ ] Add health check steps for each service
  - [ ] Set appropriate environment variables
  - [ ] Configure volumes and ports correctly

- [ ] **Test Execution**
  - [ ] Configure Python environment correctly
  - [ ] Set up correct PYTHONPATH
  - [ ] Use appropriate test runner script
  - [ ] Configure coverage reporting
  - [ ] Add fallback to pytest if custom test runner is missing

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Add detailed error messages
  - [ ] Implement fallback options where appropriate
  - [ ] Add debugging information steps
  - [ ] Configure appropriate exit codes

## 3. Testing and Verification

- [ ] **Local Verification**
  - [ ] Verify all tests pass locally
  - [ ] Check coverage reporting works
  - [ ] Test service container integration

- [ ] **CI Verification**
  - [ ] Create a test PR to trigger the workflow
  - [ ] Verify workflow runs successfully end-to-end
  - [ ] Check detailed logs for any warnings or errors
  - [ ] Validate test results and coverage output

- [ ] **SSH Verification**
  - [ ] Verify SSH authentication works correctly
  - [ ] Check submodule access (if applicable)
  - [ ] Verify SSH debugging steps provide useful information

- [ ] **Error Recovery**
  - [ ] Test workflow with simulated authentication failure
  - [ ] Test workflow with simulated test failures
  - [ ] Verify error handling provides clear diagnostic information

## 4. Documentation

- [ ] **README Updates**
  - [ ] Document CI/CD workflow purpose and behavior
  - [ ] List required secrets
  - [ ] Explain test execution process
  - [ ] Document environment setup requirements

- [ ] **Workflow Documentation**
  - [ ] Add inline comments to workflow file
  - [ ] Document non-standard or complex steps
  - [ ] Explain environment variable usage
  - [ ] Document service container configuration

- [ ] **Developer Guide**
  - [ ] Create or update developer setup guide
  - [ ] Document local test execution
  - [ ] Explain CI/CD process for new contributors
  - [ ] Include troubleshooting guidelines

## 5. Maintenance Considerations

- [ ] **Monitoring Plan**
  - [ ] Define how workflow performance will be monitored
  - [ ] Document expected failure modes
  - [ ] Establish acceptable workflow duration baselines

- [ ] **Version Updates**
  - [ ] Document GitHub Actions versions used
  - [ ] Identify dependencies with potential deprecation issues
  - [ ] Create plan for regular updates to workflow

- [ ] **Knowledge Transfer**
  - [ ] Document key implementation decisions
  - [ ] Create onboarding materials for new developers
  - [ ] Consider creating video walkthroughs for complex workflows

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: "Repository not found" errors during checkout
- **Solution**: Ensure SSH is configured before checkout step, verify deploy keys have correct permissions

### Submodule Access
- **Problem**: Submodule initialization fails
- **Solution**: Initialize submodules manually after SSH setup, use explicit Git commands

### Service Container Failures
- **Problem**: Service containers fail to start or are unhealthy
- **Solution**: Add explicit health checks, include detailed logs for debugging

### Test Execution Issues
- **Problem**: Tests pass locally but fail in CI
- **Solution**: Ensure environment variables match between local and CI environments, check PYTHONPATH configuration

### Volume Mount Issues
- **Problem**: Invalid volume specification errors
- **Solution**: Use ${{ runner.temp }} for temporary storage, avoid complex path expressions
