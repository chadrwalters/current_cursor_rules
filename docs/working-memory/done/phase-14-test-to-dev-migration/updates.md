## Latest Build Status
- PR: #26 (feature/validate-dev-pipeline ‚Üí dev)
- Status: üîÑ Build Running
- Critical Validation Points:
  * GitHub Actions workflow triggers
  * Environment variable configuration
  * Test runner environment handling
  * Lambda layer deployment
  * Resource tagging
  * Environment configuration

üöÄ **Active Validation**: PR #26 build is currently running to validate the migration from test to dev branch. This is a critical test of our updated CI/CD configuration and will verify that all components work correctly with the new branch strategy.

üöÄ **Terminology Clarification**: Added an important clarification to the plan about distinguishing between "test" as a branch/environment name versus "test" as an activity (running tests). This will help ensure we're surgical in our changes and avoid confusion. Decided to rename `.github/actions/setup-test-env` to `.github/actions/setup-ci-env` to clearly indicate its purpose is for CI setup.

üöÄ **Additional Review**: Found several more instances of hardcoded "test" references that need updating. These include CI workflow trigger branches, deployment job conditions, test runner scripts, and documentation references. Updated the plan with specific examples and code snippets.

üöÄ **Test Runner Updates**: Updated all test runner scripts to handle ENV dynamically:
- Modified `da_framework_test_runner.sh`
- Modified `da_flask_test_runner.sh`
- Updated `.github/workflows/test-helper.sh`
- Updated `docs/templates/test-runner-template.sh`
- Added branch-based ENV setting with fallback to test
- Maintained test configuration independence

üöÄ **CI Workflow Updates**: Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to:
- Add dev branch to pull_request and push triggers
- Replace all references to setup-test-env with setup-ci-env
- Maintain existing functionality while supporting new branch strategy

üöÄ **Action Updates**: Successfully renamed `.github/actions/setup-test-env` to `.github/actions/setup-ci-env` and updated its implementation to:
- Use a more accurate name and description
- Dynamically set ENV based on the branch (dev or test)
- Keep test configuration independent of deployment environment
- Add clarifying comments

üöÄ **Branch Creation**: Successfully created the dev branch from test and pushed it to origin. The branch is ready for configuration and updates.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Branch Protection**: Attempted to configure minimal branch protection via GitHub API but encountered technical issues. Will need to configure branch protection through the GitHub web interface to:
- Keep dev branch generally unprotected
- No required status checks
- No required reviews
- Add protection against branch deletion only

## Decisions Log

### 2025-04-08
- Be surgical in updating "test" references - only change those related to branches/environments, not testing activities
- Rename `.github/actions/setup-test-env` to `.github/actions/setup-ci-env` to clarify its purpose
- Add explanatory comments to code where "test" vs "dev" environment is being set
- Use consistent terminology in documentation to distinguish testing activities from deployment environments
- Need to decide on approach for handling hardcoded ENV=test in test runners
- Protect dev branch against deletion while keeping all other settings relaxed
- Keep dev branch generally unprotected with no required checks or reviews (same as test branch)
- Allow direct pushes to dev branch for flexibility during development
- Use the same IAM role/permissions for both Dev and Test environments in Sandbox account
- Focus implementation on Dev environment, leaving Test environment for future implementation
- Branch naming will use `dev` (not `develop`) for consistency with existing patterns
- Maintain current CI/CD workflow structure but update branch references

## Issues Encountered

- Need to carefully distinguish between "test" as an environment name versus "test" as an activity
- Multiple scripts contain hardcoded `ENV=test` that need to be updated
- Workflow branch triggers only include `main` and `test` (need to add `dev`)
- Deployment job only runs on `test` branch (needs to run on `dev` branch)
- `.github/actions/setup-test-env` action is named specifically for test environment but needs to work with dev environment
- Documentation contains multiple references to "test branch deploys to sandbox"

## Next Steps

1. Create the dev branch from current test branch
2. Configure minimal branch protection (prevent deletion only)
3. Rename `.github/actions/setup-test-env` to `.github/actions/setup-ci-env` and update implementation
4. Update CI workflows, test runners, and documentation with careful attention to terminology
5. Update GitHub Actions workflows to target dev branch
6. Update deployment scripts
7. Test the new workflow with a sample change
8. Prepare team communication materials

## Decisions Log

### 2025-04-09
- Implement Job Conditional Visibility approach for GitHub Actions workflows
- Use simplified condition: `github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/dev'`
- Keep all functionality in a single workflow file to preserve submodule handling
- Consider adding a deployment status informational job for PRs targeting dev
- Add documentation about this approach to plan.md

### 2025-04-08
- Be surgical in updating "test" references - only change those related to branches/environments, not testing activities
- Rename `.github/actions/setup-test-env` to `.github/actions/setup-ci-env` to clarify its purpose
- Add explanatory comments to code where "test" vs "dev" environment is being set
- Use consistent terminology in documentation to distinguish testing activities from deployment environments
- Need to decide on approach for handling hardcoded ENV=test in test runners

### Completed
1. PR Merge Investigation (Task 7.4):
   - Used squash merge to merge PR #28 into dev
   - Observed unexpected but explainable behavior:
     * Squash merge was treated as a direct push to dev
     * Full workflow ran including all jobs:
       - Debug Context ‚úÖ
       - Check Duplicate Run ‚úÖ
       - Lint Submodules ‚úÖ (1m37s)
       - Lint Main Repository ‚úÖ (1m39s)
       - Run Tests ‚úÖ (3m11s)
       - Deploy ‚úÖ (1m40s)
       - Check Required Status ‚úÖ
   - Learning: Squash merges don't trigger our merge skip logic
   - Reason: Squash creates new commit directly on target branch
   - Impact: For proper merge skip testing, should use "Create a merge commit"

### Working Components
1. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Status: ‚úÖ All jobs completed successfully
   - Execution Time: ~8 minutes total
   - Coverage Reports Generated:
     * lint-main-repo
