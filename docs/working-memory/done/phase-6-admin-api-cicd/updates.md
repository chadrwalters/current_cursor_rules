Last Updated: 2025-04-01 13:42:02 CDT

## Updates

### 2025-04-01 13:17:00 CDT - Project Initialized

- Created implementation plan
- Set up Phase 6 documentation structure
- Identified key dependencies and requirements
- Added section to project-plan.md
- Next steps:

  - Enhance test_runner.sh with coverage support 

### 2025-04-01 13:20:34 CDT - Initial Assessment üü°

**Current Status:** In Progress (üü°)

**Environment Assessment Complete:**
- Docker environment configured with PostgreSQL, Redis, and LocalStack
- Submodules present but need initialization: da_flask and da_framework
- GitHub workflow file (test-and-coverage.yml) exists but needs verification
- setenv.sh adapted from data-api but needs testing
- test_runner.sh exists but needs coverage enhancements

**Current Issues:**
- Submodules showing negative commit IDs (not initialized)
- test_runner.sh lacks coverage reporting functionality
- GitHub Secrets for deploy keys not verified

**Next Steps:**
1. Initialize submodules and verify access
2. Update test_runner.sh to include coverage reporting
3. Verify GitHub workflow configuration
4. Test service containers locally

**Progress Against Plan:**
- [x] Docker configuration completed (docker-compose.yml)
- [x] Initial GitHub workflow file created
- [ ] Submodule initialization and verification
- [ ] test_runner.sh enhancement
- [ ] Local environment testing

**Testing Environment Setup:**
- Coverage reports will be saved to `coverage_reports/` directory
- Configured for HTML, XML, and terminal reports
- Set minimum coverage threshold at 35% (matching data-api)
- Test paths configured for proper discovery
- Filtering configured to exclude submodules from coverage

**Current Issues:**
- Need to verify environment setup locally

# Admin API CI/CD Implementation - Status Updates

Last Updated: 2025-04-01 13:42:02 CDT

## Updates

### 2025-04-01 13:17:00 CDT - Project Initialized

- Created implementation plan
- Set up Phase 6 documentation structure
- Identified key dependencies and requirements
- Added section to project-plan.md
- Next steps:
  - Initialize and verify submodules
  - Adapt setenv.sh for admin_api structure
  - Enhance test_runner.sh with coverage support 

### 2025-04-01 13:20:34 CDT - Initial Assessment üü°

**Current Status:** In Progress (üü°)

**Environment Assessment Complete:**
- Docker environment configured with PostgreSQL, Redis, and LocalStack
- Submodules present but need initialization: da_flask and da_framework
- GitHub workflow file (test-and-coverage.yml) exists but needs verification
- setenv.sh adapted from data-api but needs testing
- test_runner.sh exists but needs coverage enhancements

**Current Issues:**
- Submodules showing negative commit IDs (not initialized)
- test_runner.sh lacks coverage reporting functionality
- GitHub Secrets for deploy keys not verified

**Next Steps:**
1. Initialize submodules and verify access
2. Update test_runner.sh to include coverage reporting
3. Verify GitHub workflow configuration
4. Test service containers locally
