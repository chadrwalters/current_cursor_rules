# Phase 8: Spark API CI/CD Implementation Updates

## Latest Status (2025-04-02 12:46:04 CDT)

### Completed
1. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
   - Configured GitHub Actions workflow for test and coverage
   - Set up SSH keys and secrets for submodule access
   - Removed redundant submodule-verification.yml workflow
   - Verified submodule initialization works locally

2. Pre-commit Configuration (Task 8.1.5):
   - Aligned with school_api's lighter linting approach
   - Updated .pre-commit-config.yaml to match school_api
   - Added setup.cfg for flake8 configuration
   - Verified all pre-commit hooks pass successfully

### In Progress
1. CI Pipeline Verification:
   - Changes pushed to branch chadrwalters/eng-128
   - Waiting for GitHub Actions workflow to complete
   - Need to verify:
     - Test execution
     - Coverage reporting
     - PR comments/checks

### Working Components
1. Test Infrastructure:
   - test_runner.sh: Working locally
   - setenv.sh: Configured and verified
   - pytest.ini: Coverage reporting enabled
   - Status: Verified locally, pending CI verification

2. Pre-commit Hooks:
   - Configuration: Matches school_api standards
   - Hooks: All passing (trailing whitespace, end of files, yaml, flake8)
   - Status: Fully verified locally

3. GitHub Actions:
   - Workflow: test-and-coverage.yml
   - Status: Configuration complete, awaiting verification
   - Dependencies: All secrets and keys configured

## Next Steps
1. Test submodule verification workflow
2. Implement main CI/CD workflow
3. Configure deployment stages
4. Complete documentation

## Issues/Blockers
None currently. Awaiting verification of submodule workflow.
