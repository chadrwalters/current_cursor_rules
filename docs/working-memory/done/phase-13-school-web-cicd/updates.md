## Decisions Log

### 2025-04-08 09:24:40
🤔 Decided to copy configuration files from admin_web rather than writing from scratch
 Will need to adapt all copied files to school_web-specific needs

### 2025-04-08 09:23:07
🤔 Confirmed react-components is hosted on GitHub, not Bitbucket based on .gitmodules
🤔 Simplified Git configuration to focus only on GitHub URLs

### 2025-04-08 09:21:49
🤔 Decided to follow the exact submodule pattern from howtogetsubmodulestowork.md
🤔 Determined we need both SCHOOL_WEB_DEPLOY_KEY and REACT_COMPONENTS_DEPLOY_KEY secrets

### 2025-04-08 09:19:41
🤔 Decided to follow Phase 11 (Admin Web CI) implementation pattern
🤔 Determined initial test coverage requirements should be minimal (1%)
🤔 Selected sort.js utility and security.js component as initial test targets
🤔 Decided to use light-touch ESLint configuration to minimize disruption

## Issues Encountered

### 2025-04-08 09:24:40
❌ Missing explicit file copying steps in original plan
✓ Added detailed instructions for copying and adapting admin_web files

### 2025-04-08 09:23:07
