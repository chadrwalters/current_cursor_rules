# Phase 13: School Web CI Implementation [ENG-134] - Summary

_Last Updated: 2025-04-08 21:22:00 UTC_

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive CI pipeline for the school_web repository, focusing on automated testing, code quality, and build verification. The implementation includes proper handling of the react-components submodule and follows established patterns from the Admin Web CI/CD implementation.

## Key Achievements

1. **Repository Structure**
   - Established GitHub Actions workflow directory
   - Created scripts for build verification
   - Set up test directory structure

2. **CI Pipeline Implementation**
   - Configured GitHub Actions workflow with submodule support
   - Implemented SSH key management for secure submodule access
   - Set up dependency caching and installation
   - Configured test coverage reporting

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created initial test suite
   - Configured Jest with coverage thresholds
   - Implemented utility and component tests

4. **Code Quality Tools**
   - Configured ESLint with appropriate rules
   - Set up pre-commit hooks
   - Implemented cfn-lint for CloudFormation

5. **Build Verification**
   - Adapted and customized verify-start.js
   - Configured CI environment variables
   - Implemented comprehensive build validation

## Technical Details

- **Testing Framework**: Jest with coverage reporting
- **Linting**: ESLint with customized ruleset
- **Build Verification**: Node.js-based verification script
- **Submodule Handling**: SSH-based with deploy keys
- **CI Platform**: GitHub Actions

## Impact

The implementation provides:
- Automated code quality checks
- Consistent testing infrastructure
- Reliable build verification
- Secure submodule handling
- Foundation for future CD implementation
