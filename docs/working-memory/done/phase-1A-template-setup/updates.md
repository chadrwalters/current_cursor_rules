# Phase 1.A: Template Repository Setup - Updates Log
Last Updated: 2025-03-24 10:00:34 CDT

## Current Status
‚úÖ Template repository setup complete
- Repository structure complete
- CI workflows standardized and validated
- Merge settings configured
- Branch protection rules implemented and tested
- Team access configured
- All validations passed

## Progress History

### 2025-03-24 10:00:34 CDT
‚úì Completed final validation:
  - Branch protection rules working (direct push blocked)
  - Pre-commit hooks installed and tested
  - Team access configured successfully

### 2025-03-24 09:57:47 CDT
‚úì Implemented branch protection rules using GraphQL API:
  - Required pull request reviews (1 reviewer)
  - Required status checks
  - Dismiss stale reviews
  - Admin enforcement enabled
  - Force pushes disabled
  - Branch deletions disabled

### 2025-03-24 09:55:15 CDT
‚úì Configured repository settings:
  - Enabled squash merging only
  - Enabled auto-delete of merged branches
  - Attempted branch protection setup
  - Documented manual steps needed

‚úì Standardized CI workflow filenames:
  - Confirmed node.ci.yml and python.ci.yml as standard names
  - Updated validation script to match
  - Verified setup script compatibility

‚úì Created and configured key template files:
  - GitHub workflows (Python and Node.js)
  - CODEOWNERS and PR template
  - Core documentation files
  - Development scripts
  - Pre-commit configuration

‚úì Added basic pre-commit hooks and linting
  - Basic file checks (whitespace, EOF, etc.)
  - Simple Python linting (black, isort, flake8)
  - Simple Node.js linting (prettier)

‚úì Established documentation structure
  - Working memory organization
  - Phase-specific planning
  - Progress tracking

## Decisions Log

### 2025-03-24 09:57:47 CDT
1. ü§î **Branch Protection API Approach**
   - Decision: Switch to GraphQL API for branch protection
   - Rationale: More reliable than REST API, better schema validation
   - Status: Successfully implemented
   - Reference: Perplexity research on current GitHub API best practices

### 2025-03-24 09:55:15 CDT
2. ü§î **Pre-commit Framework Selection**
   - Decision: Implement basic pre-commit framework for both Python and Node.js
   - Rationale: Ensures consistent code quality across all repositories
   - Status: Implemented
   - Reference: Initial project setup conversation

3. ü§î **CI Workflow Configuration**
   - Decision: Reversed order of requirements installation in Python CI
   - Decision: Set npm audit level to moderate
   - Rationale: Better dependency management and security
   - Status: Implemented
   - Reference: Project setup refinement discussion

4. ü§î **Documentation Organization**
   - Decision: Implement phase-specific working memory structure
   - Rationale: Better organization and tracking of phase-specific progress
   - Status: Implemented
   - Reference: Memory management system rules

## Issues Log

### 2025-03-24 09:57:47 CDT
‚úì GitHub API changes affecting branch protection
- Resolution: Successfully implemented using GraphQL API
- Impact: None, found and implemented better solution
- Reference: Perplexity research on GitHub API usage

### 2025-03-24 09:55:15 CDT
‚ùå Documentation structure not following memory management rules
- Resolution: Implemented proper working memory structure
- Impact: Minimal, caught early in the process
