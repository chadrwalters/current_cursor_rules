# Phase 11: Admin Web CI/CD Implementation Plan [ENG-127]
_Updated: 2025-04-04 11:30:00 CDT_

## Problem Analysis
The Admin Web repository needs a CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, automate testing, and prepare for future deployment processes. This is part of the organization-wide effort to standardize CI/CD across all repositories.

## Solution Design
Implement a GitHub Actions-based CI workflow for the Admin Web repository that follows established patterns from other repositories while accounting for React-specific requirements. We will first establish a solid local development and testing foundation, then implement the CI pipeline that mirrors this setup.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Code Quality Tools Setup [COMPLETED]
- [x] Set up ESLint with CRA defaults
  _Completed 2025-04-03 16:04:12 CDT_
  - Removed custom ESLint config
  - Using Create React App defaults
  - Resolved React import warnings
- [x] Verify local development environment
  _Completed 2025-04-03 16:04:12 CDT_
  - Confirmed app builds and runs
  - Documented backend requirements
  - Noted expected API behavior
- [x] Establish light touch linting approach
  _Completed 2025-04-03 16:05:33 CDT_
  - Using CRA's default ESLint rules
  - Set high warning threshold (999)
  - Only critical React Hooks rules as errors
  - Pre-commit hooks in warning-only mode

### 2. Pre-commit Hooks Implementation [COMPLETED]
- [x] Configure pre-commit for Git hooks management
- [x] Set up ESLint in warning-only mode
- [x] Add basic file checks (YAML, large files)
- [x] Test pre-commit configuration
  _Completed 2025-04-03 16:55:13 CDT_
  - Verified hooks run correctly
  - Confirmed non-blocking behavior
  - Tested with various file types

### 3. CI Pipeline Setup [COMPLETED]
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  _Completed 2025-04-03 15:41:43 CDT_
- [x] Configure Node.js environment
  _Completed 2025-04-03 15:41:43 CDT_
- [x] Review and verify CI workflow configuration
  _Completed 2025-04-03 16:10:15 CDT_
  - Verified SSH and Git configuration
  - Checked Node.js setup (v18.x)
  - Confirmed dependency installation (npm ci)
  - Validated Python setup for pre-commit
  - Test pre-commit hook execution
  - Verified ESLint integration with light touch approach
  - Confirmed test coverage reporting
  - Added build verification step
  - Implemented smoke test
- [x] Test CI workflow on current branch
  _Completed 2025-04-04 11:30:00 CDT_
  - PR #3 created
  - Fixed submodule test execution issue
  - Fixed Jest configuration to exclude shared submodule tests
  - All CI checks passing

### 4. Documentation Updates [IN PROGRESS]
- [x] Update README with linting philosophy
- [x] Document local development setup
- [x] Add troubleshooting guide
  _Completed 2025-04-04 06:46:19 CDT_
  - Added comprehensive troubleshooting guide
  - Included real-world examples from recent issues
  - Covered development, testing, and CI/CD topics
- [ ] Create CI/CD documentation

## Current Focus
1. Complete CI/CD documentation

## Testing Plan
- [x] Verify pre-commit hooks run correctly in CI
- [x] Confirm ESLint follows light touch approach
- [x] Validate test coverage reporting
- [x] Check CI artifacts generation
- [x] Verify production build process
- [x] Validate app smoke test in CI environment

## Documentation Impact
- README.md updates (completed)
- CI/CD documentation (pending CI verification)
- Local development guide (completed)
- Troubleshooting documentation (completed)

## Dependencies
- GitHub repository access
- Node.js environment
- Pre-commit tool installation
