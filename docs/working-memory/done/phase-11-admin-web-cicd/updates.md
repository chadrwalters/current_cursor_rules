🎯 Ready to expand test coverage to core components
📋 Planning careful approach to implement only necessary changes

## Progress History
### 2025-04-03 16:04:12 CDT
- ✅ Simplified ESLint configuration:
  - Removed custom `.eslintrc.js`
  - Using Create React App's default ESLint config
  - Resolved React import warnings
  - Confirmed local development environment working
- 🔧 Environment setup:
  - Verified `.env.local` configuration
  - Noted backend service requirements
  - Documented expected API connection behavior
- 📋 Next steps:
  - Continue with pre-commit hooks setup
  - Implement core component tests
  - Set up CI pipeline testing

### 2025-04-03 15:31:43 CDT
- ✅ Set up proper Jest configuration:
  - Created jest.config.js with proper defaults
  - Configured coverage reporting and thresholds
  - Set up module mocking for assets
  - Disabled watch mode by default
- 🔧 Reorganized test files:
  - Moved tests next to their implementation files
  - Fixed import paths after moving
  - Established __tests__ directory pattern
- 📋 Updated npm scripts:
  - `npm test` - Run tests once (no watch)
  - `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
  - `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- 🎯 Next steps:
  - Review and revert unintended changes
  - Focus strictly on planned scope:
    1. ESLint configuration
    2. Pre-commit hooks
    3. CI pipeline setup
    4. Documentation updates

### 2025-04-03 12:38:46 CDT
- 📋 Detailed analysis of existing tests:
  - date_utils.test.js: Comprehensive tests for time conversion
    - Tests convertToTime function with various inputs
    - Includes edge cases and invalid inputs
  - query_utils.test.js: SQL query parsing tests
    - Tests parseQuery function for different SQL formats
    - Covers complex queries with CTEs and joins
- 🔍 Tests are well-structured but limited in scope
- 🎯 Next: Create Jest configuration and expand test coverage

### 2025-04-03 12:37:46 CDT
- 📊 Ran coverage analysis:
  - Overall coverage: 1.01% statements, 1.03% branches, 0.83% functions
  - Files with good coverage:
    - date_utils.js (88.88% statements)
    - query_utils.js (94.28% statements)
  - Most files have 0% coverage
- 🎯 Next: Create Jest configuration and start writing tests for core components

### 2025-04-03 12:37:14 CDT
- ✅ Ran existing test suite:
  - All tests passing (29 tests across 2 suites)
  - date_utils.test.js: PASS
  - query_utils.test.js: PASS
- 🔧 Identified need to run tests in CI mode for non-interactive execution
- 🎯 Next: Configure and analyze test coverage

### 2025-04-03 12:36:02 CDT
- 🔍 Discovered existing test infrastructure:
  - Found setupTests.js with @testing-library/jest-dom configuration
  - Located existing tests in src/tests/ directory:
    - date_utils.test.js
    - query_utils.test.js
  - Confirmed testing dependencies in package.json
- 📋 Updated implementation plan to reflect existing test setup
- 🎯 Next: Review current test coverage and plan additional tests

## Current Status
⏳ Moving to Husky pre-commit hooks setup after completing ESLint configuration

## Progress History
### 2025-04-03 12:30:22 CDT
- ✅ Completed all ESLint fixes and verifications
- 🎯 Ready to proceed with Husky pre-commit hooks setup
- 📋 Updated documentation to reflect current status

## Current Status
⏳ Implementing Local Development Setup - Fixing remaining ESLint warnings before proceeding with Husky setup

## Progress History
### 2025-04-03 12:28:43 CDT
- 🔧 Fixed ESLint warnings:
  - Removed unused Warehouse import
  - Fixed HeaderView displayName
  - Cleaned up unused variables
  - Fixed React Hook dependencies
- 📋 Updated implementation plan with clearer task status tracking
- 🎯 Next focus: Complete remaining ESLint fixes before Husky setup

### 2025-04-03 12:11:38 CDT
- ✅ Set up ESLint with light-touch configuration
  - Enforcing double quotes
  - No semicolon enforcement
  - Basic error prevention only
  - Minimal React-specific rules
- ✅ Configured Prettier to match ESLint preferences
- ✅ Added lint and format scripts to package.json

### 2025-04-03 12:10:13 CDT
- 🔄 Reorganized implementation plan to focus on local setup first
- 🤔 Decided to establish solid testing foundation locally before CI setup
- 📋 Created clearer sequence of implementation steps

### 2025-04-03 12:00:18 CDT
- 🏁 Created initial implementation plan
- 📋 Established requirements for CI pipeline
- 🔍 Reviewed react-components and other repositories for patterns
- 📚 Documented approach for SSH key setup

## Decisions Log
- 🤔 Decided to focus on local setup before implementing CI pipeline
- 🤔 Decided to target 10% coverage initially, with plans to increase over time
- 🤔 Selected "light-touch" approach for ESLint following react-components pattern
- 🤔 Will use identical lint configurations for CI and pre-commit hooks
- 🤔 Will exclude submodules from testing and coverage calculations

## Issues Encountered
None yet.

## Next Steps
- Set up ESLint and Prettier locally
- Implement Husky pre-commit hooks
- Create basic tests for core components
- Configure Jest with coverage reporting
- Verify submodule functionality locally
- Only then proceed with SSH key generation and CI setup
