# Phase 9: Integrations API CI/CD Implementation [ENG-131]
_Last Updated: 2025-04-03 11:33:12 CDT_

## Overview
Successfully implemented CI/CD pipeline for the Integrations API repository, establishing proper testing infrastructure and code quality tools. This phase extends the CI/CD implementation pattern established in previous API repositories.

## Key Achievements
- Set up submodules with proper deploy key configuration
- Implemented test runner with coverage reporting
- Configured service containers (PostgreSQL, Redis, LocalStack)
- Added pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Achieved 49.69% test coverage (above 40% threshold)

## Technical Approach
- Used pytest with coverage reporting
- Configured flake8 with permissive rules
- Set up black and isort for code formatting
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow
- Added service container health checks

## Benefits Realized
- Automated testing ensures API reliability
- Code quality tools maintain consistent standards
- Coverage reporting provides visibility
- Service containers enable comprehensive testing
- Pre-commit hooks catch issues early

## Lessons Learned
- Submodule configuration requires precise deploy key setup
- Service container health checks are critical
- Light-touch linting approach helps adoption
- Coverage thresholds should be repository-specific
- Database schema mismatches need careful handling
