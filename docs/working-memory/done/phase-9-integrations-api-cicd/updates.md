# Phase 9: Integrations API CI/CD Implementation [ENG-131] Updates
_Last Updated: 2025-04-02 14:05:23 CDT_

## Current Status
‚è≥ **In Progress** - GitHub Actions workflow updated with pre-commit checks and correct submodule paths. Ready for testing.

## Progress History

### 2025-04-02 14:05:23 CDT
- ‚úì Updated GitHub Actions workflow:
  - Fixed submodule paths to match current structure
  - Added pre-commit checks step
  - Added flake8 plugins installation
  - Updated deploy key configuration
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Test the workflow with a PR

### 2025-04-02 14:03:36 CDT
- ‚úì Created .pre-commit-config.yaml with essential hooks:
  - Basic file checks (trailing whitespace, EOL, YAML, etc.)
  - Merge conflict detection
  - Debug statement checks
  - Private key detection
  - Flake8 with docstring and quote style checks
- ‚úì Added .flake8 with permissive rules:
  - Line length: 120
  - Complexity: 15
  - Ignored docstring requirements
  - Relaxed code style rules
- ‚úì Installed pre-commit and flake8 plugins
- ‚úì Set up pre-commit hooks in git
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Configure GitHub Actions workflow

### 2025-04-02 14:00:23 CDT
- ‚úì Created setenv.sh for consistent environment configuration
- ‚úì Updated test_runner.sh to use pytest with coverage reporting
- ‚úì Added .coveragerc with basic coverage settings
- ‚úì Set coverage threshold to 40% as per plan
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Set up light-touch linting with pre-commit hooks

### 2025-04-02 13:59:44 CDT
- ‚úì Generated deploy keys for all repositories with correct URL patterns
- ‚úì Added deploy keys to da_framework, da_flask, and integrationsapi repositories
- ‚úì Added private keys as repository secrets:
  - DA_FRAMEWORK_DEPLOY_KEY
  - DA_FLASK_DEPLOY_KEY
  - INTEGRATIONS_API_DEPLOY_KEY
- ‚úì Updated .gitmodules with correct paths and branch specifications
- ‚úì Successfully initialized and updated submodules
- ‚úì Added deploy key files to .gitignore
- üìã Cleanup plan for deploy keys:
  - Files to delete after CI verification:
    ```
    da-framework
    da-framework.pub
    da-flask
    da-flask.pub
    integrations-api
    integrations-api.pub
    ```
  - Keys should be deleted only after:
    1. GitHub Actions workflow is implemented
    2. Test PR successfully verifies submodule access
    3. Full CI pipeline runs successfully
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Update test_runner.sh with coverage reporting

### 2025-04-02 13:55:55 CDT
- ‚úì Reviewed howtogetsubmodulestowork.md for exact deploy key setup process
- üìã Prepared detailed steps for deploy key generation:
  1. Generate keys with exact GitHub URL pattern:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f da-framework -N "" -C "git@github.com:degree-analytics/da_framework.git"
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f da-flask -N "" -C "git@github.com:degree-analytics/da_flask.git"
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f integrations-api -N "" -C "git@github.com:degree-analytics/integrations-api.git"
     ```
  2. Add public keys to respective repositories using GitHub CLI
  3. Add private keys as repository secrets
  4. Configure .gitmodules with correct paths and SSH URLs
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Execute deploy key generation and setup

### 2025-04-02 13:53:48 CDT
- ‚úì Updated plan with details on light-touch linting approach
- ‚úì Added explicit references to deploy key setup process from howtogetsubmodulestowork.md
- ü§î Decision to follow light-touch linting standards from admin_api repository
- ü§î Decision to strictly follow the deploy key setup process in howtogetsubmodulestowork.md

### 2025-04-02 13:51:27 CDT
- ‚úì Updated project-plan.md with Phase 9 information
- ‚úì Created detailed implementation plan
- ‚úì Set up working memory directory structure
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Initialize submodules and update test runner

### 2025-04-02 16:03:05 CDT
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-commit checks failing in GitHub Actions:
  - Multiple code style and quality issues identified:
    * Line length violations (>120 chars) in multiple files
    * Docstring formatting issues across the codebase
    * Critical code issues found:
      - Undefined variables in dna_spaces_api.py
      - F-string errors in oauth.py
      - Code complexity in OauthTokenResource.get
    * YAML validation errors with CloudFormation tags
- ‚úì Installed pre-commit hooks locally
- ‚úì Configured Git to use hooks
- ‚úì Verified hooks are running on commit
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Address code quality issues systematically once build completes

## Decisions Log
- ü§î Decision to follow same pattern as School API, Admin API, Data API, and Spark API for consistency
- ü§î Minimum coverage threshold set to 40% to match previous implementations
- ü§î Decision to follow light-touch linting standards from admin_api repository
- ü§î Decision to strictly follow the deploy key setup process in howtogetsubmodulestowork.md

## Issues Encountered
- Pre-commit checks failing in GitHub Actions workflow
- Code quality issues more extensive than initially anticipated
- Need to balance between strict code quality and maintaining functionality

## Next Steps
1. Wait for current GitHub Actions build to complete
2. Analyze build logs for any additional issues
3. Create plan to address code quality issues:
   - Critical code issues first (undefined vars, f-string errors)
   - Documentation and style issues second
   - Line length and complexity issues last

1. Generate deploy keys following the exact process in docs/ci/howtogetsubmodulestowork.md
2. Initialize submodules using git submodule commands
3. Update test_runner.sh based on the attached admin_api example
4. Implement light-touch linting configuration from admin_api
