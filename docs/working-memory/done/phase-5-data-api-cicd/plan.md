✅ 2. All tests pass in CI
✅ 3. Coverage meets threshold requirements
✅ 4. PR comments working perfectly
✅ 5. Service containers healthy and reliable

## Phase Completion Notes
- Implementation successful and verified
- Pattern ready for reuse in other repositories
- Documentation complete and accurate
- No outstanding issues or concerns
- Ready for project closure

## Timeline
- Workflow Setup: 1 day
- Service Integration: 1 day
- Test & PR Integration: 1 day
- Total: 3 working days

## Success Criteria
1. Workflow matches events repository exactly
2. All tests pass in CI
3. Coverage meets 90% threshold
4. PR comments working
5. Service containers healthy

## Next Actions
1. Create `.github/workflows/test-and-coverage.yml`
2. Copy events workflow content exactly
3. Update repository-specific values
4. Test with PR
5. Document working pattern

## Notes
- Following events repository pattern exactly
- Using same workflow naming convention
- Using same service container configuration
- Maintaining same environment variables
- Using identical PR process

## Implementation Order

   - Complete test runner setup
   - Implement coverage reporting
   - Configure result collection

2. **Code Quality (Day 3)**
   - Implement all linters
   - Configure formatters
   - Set up PR integration

3. **Advanced Features (Day 4-5)**
   - Security scanning
   - Performance testing
   - Metric collection

4. **Documentation (Day 6)**
   - Update all guides
   - Create templates
   - Finalize standards
