## 2025-04-01 08:07:28 CDT - Critical Finding: Deploy Key Access Requirements

During the implementation of the submodule verification workflow, we discovered a critical requirement regarding deploy keys for private submodules:

- **Finding**: Deploy keys must have write access, not just read access, even when only cloning repositories
- **Impact**: Using read-only deploy keys results in "Repository not found" errors during submodule initialization
- **Root Cause**: Git requires write access to clone private repositories, even for read-only operations
- **Resolution**: Updated all deploy keys to have write access and documented this requirement in:
  - Workflow file comments
  - Implementation plan
  - Debug checklist
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved - All deploy keys now have appropriate write access 

## 2025-04-01 08:12:56 CDT - Deploy Key Requirements and Best Practices

### Investigation Results
- Analyzed deploy key setup across `events`, `python_frameworks`, and `data-api` repositories
- Found that `events` repository has the cleanest and most reliable setup
- Discovered critical requirements for deploy keys with private submodules

### Key Findings
1. Deploy keys for private submodules must have write access, not just read access
2. Git requires write access to clone private repositories, even if only reading
3. Using read-only deploy keys results in "Repository not found" errors
4. Multiple deploy keys can cause confusion and access issues

### Best Practices Established
1. Use a single deploy key per repository with write access
2. Follow the `events` repository pattern:
   - Single deploy key with write access
   - Proper SSH configuration
   - Detailed debug logging
3. Clean up old/unused deploy keys
4. Document deploy key requirements in workflow files

### Next Steps
1. Clean up deploy keys in all repositories to follow best practices
2. Update workflow documentation to reflect these requirements
3. Implement consistent deploy key setup across all repositories
