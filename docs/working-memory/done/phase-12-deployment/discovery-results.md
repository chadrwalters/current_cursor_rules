## Environment Configuration

### Dev/Test Environment (Verified)
- Account: 881490112168 (sandbox)
- Purpose: Development and testing environment
- Primary Region: us-east-2 (verified)
- Secondary Region: us-east-1 (only mistevents and CF template buckets)
- Deployment Strategy:
  - ✓ Using 881490112168-code-deployment bucket for all deployments
  - ✓ Following new pattern: {account-id}-code-deployment
  - ✓ Deployment handled by deploy script
  - ✓ Layer naming convention: {environment}-{package}-layer (with underscores converted to hyphens)
  - ✓ Test deployments confirmed working via deploy script

## Access Verification
- ✓ Successfully assumed SandboxAdminRole
- ✓ Can list AWS resources
- ✓ Can query Lambda layers
- ✓ Can list and query S3 buckets
- ✓ Can query CloudFormation stacks

## Implementation Plan
### Dev/Test (Sandbox Account)
1. Use 881490112168-code-deployment bucket for all deployments
   - Follows new standardized pattern
   - Deployment handled by deploy script
   - Deploy script already tested and working
2. Continue using existing Lambda layers:
   - dev-da-framework-layer (✓ exists)
   - dev-da-flask-layer (✓ exists)
3. Create CloudFormation stacks for:
   - Framework deployment
   - Flask deployment
4. Implement deployment pipeline for test branch

## Questions for Confirmation
1. Dev/Test Environment:
   - ✓ Sandbox account access confirmed (881490112168)
   - ✓ Primary region us-east-2 confirmed
   - ✓ Using 881490112168-code-deployment for all deployments
   - ✓ Deployment bucket follows new standardized pattern
   - ✓ Deploy script tested and working with correct naming conventions

## Next Steps
1. Review existing deploy script implementation (✓ done)
2. Integrate deploy script into CI/CD pipeline
3. Set up GitHub Actions workflow
