✅ Documentation complete (pending final updates)

## Problem Analysis

The python_frameworks repository currently has CI/CD workflows for testing and linting, but lacks the ability to deploy artifacts to AWS. We need to extend the CI pipeline to deploy Lambda layers to both test and production environments based on which branch (test or main) the code is pushed to.

Key challenges:

- Securing AWS credentials in GitHub Actions
- Creating appropriate IAM policies with minimal permissions
- Branch-specific deployments (test branch → sandbox, main branch → prod)
- Integration with existing CI workflow
- Creating a new test branch for deployment testing

## Solution Design

### AWS Authentication

- Create a dedicated IAM deployment user with restricted permissions
- Store AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets
- Use aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials Action

### CI Workflow Enhancement

- Extend existing CI workflow with a conditional deployment job
- Make deployment conditional on branch (test or main)
- Environment selection based on branch (test → sandbox, main → prod)

### Branch Strategy

- Create a test branch from main
- Code flow: feature branch → test branch → main branch
- Deploy automatically on successful builds to test/main

     # Create policy
     aws iam create-policy \
       --policy-name github-ci-deploy-policy \
       --policy-document file://github-ci-deploy-policy.json \
       --profile sandbox

     # Attach policy to user

   - [x] Generate and secure access credentials
     ```bash
     # Access key created
     AccessKeyId: AKIA42PHHV2UDUVR6ILI
     Created: 2025-04-07T17:30:16+00:00
     Status: Active
     ```

4. **GitHub Configuration** 🔄

   - [x] Set up AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets:
     ```bash
     # Sandbox environment secrets
     AWS_SANDBOX_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA42PHHV2UDUVR6ILI
     AWS_SANDBOX_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[secure]
     AWS_SANDBOX_REGION=us-east-2
     ```
   - [x] Create test branch
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull
     git checkout -b test
     git push -u origin test
     ```
   - [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow:

     ```yaml
     # Template ready for implementation
     name: AWS Deployment

     on:
       push:
         branches: [main, test]

     jobs:
       deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         environment: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'production' || 'sandbox' }}
     ```

   - [ ] Set up branch protection rules
   - [ ] Test deployment process

5. **CI Workflow Update**

   - [ ] Add AWS credential configuration
   - [ ] Configure environment selection
   - [ ] Add safety checks

6. **Testing & Validation**

   - [ ] Document test results

7. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update deployment guide
   - [ ] Document GitHub Actions workflow
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Create runbook

## Project Documentation

- [x] Project plan structure maintained
- [x] AWS deployment progress updated
- [x] Working memory synchronized
- [x] Task tracking updated

## Next Actions

1. Push current changes to feature branch
2. Create PR against test branch
3. Monitor CI workflow execution
4. After success, merge to test
5. Verify deployment workflow

## Affected Components

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Workflow definition
- `deploy` script - Used by CI for deployment (✓ updated)
- New IAM user and policies in AWS
- New test branch in repository

## Testing Plan

1. **Local Testing**

   - Validate deploy script with test credentials
   - Verify AWS permissions model

2. **CI Testing**

   - Push to test branch and verify test deployment
   - Check for proper environment selection
   - Validate AWS resources created

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify Lambda layers are accessible
   - Ensure CloudFormation stacks are created/updated correctly

## Documentation Impact

- Update `README.md` with deployment information
- Create deployment architecture diagram
- Document branch workflow
- Create AWS permission model documentation

## Dependencies

- AWS Account access (✓ confirmed)
- Permission to create branches in repository
- GitHub repository settings access for secrets

## AWS CLI Configuration

The implementation assumes AWS CLI is properly configured on both local development machines and CI/CD environments:

1. **Local Development Setup**

   - AWS CLI installed (version 2.0+)
   - Configured with appropriate credentials
   - Testing should use the new limited-access deployment user

2. **GitHub Actions Configuration**

   - Will use aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
   - Credentials will be passed from GitHub Secrets
   - Action will automatically handle credential management

3. **AWS Profile Management**

   - For local testing:

     ```bash
     # Configure a specific profile for deployment testing
     aws configure --profile github-deploy

     # Test the deploy script with the profile
     ./deploy --environment dev --profile github-deploy da_flask
     ./deploy --environment dev --profile github-deploy da_framework
     ```

4. **Credential Security**
   - Access keys will be rotated quarterly
   - Credentials will be stored only in GitHub Secrets
   - No credentials will be committed to the repository

## Temporary Testing Configuration [2025-04-07 18:32:09 UTC]

### Current State

- Modified AWS deployment workflow to create new layer versions on every CI success
- Removed submodule change detection
- Both da_flask and da_framework layers will be deployed every time
- Safe to do this because:
  1. Lambda layer versions are immutable
  2. Functions must explicitly opt-in to new versions
  3. Existing functions continue using their current versions
  4. Easy rollback available through version selection

### Reversion Plan

After testing is complete, we will revert to only deploying on submodule changes:

1. Restore change detection job:

   ```yaml
   check-changes:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     outputs:
       da_flask_changed: ${{ steps.check-submodules.outputs.da_flask_changed }}
       da_framework_changed: ${{ steps.check-submodules.outputs.da_framework_changed }}
   ```

2. Restore conditional deployment:

   ```yaml
   deploy-da-flask:
     needs: [check-changes]
     if: needs.check-changes.outputs.da_flask_changed == 'true'

   deploy-da-framework:
     needs: [check-changes]
     if: needs.check-changes.outputs.da_framework_changed == 'true'
   ```

3. Update documentation to reflect final configuration

This change will be made after:

- [ ] Successful testing of deployment workflow
- [ ] Verification of layer versioning
- [ ] Documentation of deployment process
- [ ] Team review and approval
