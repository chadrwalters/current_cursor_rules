# Phase 10: React Components CI/CD Implementation [ENG-129]
_Last Updated: 2025-04-03 09:38:54 CDT_

## Problem Analysis
The React Components repository requires a CI/CD pipeline setup to ensure code quality and enable automated testing. Unlike previous repositories (which were Python-based), this is a JavaScript/React component library used as a submodule in web applications. The repository currently has no testing infrastructure, no package.json, and no formal Node.js configuration.

## Solution Design
We will implement a CI/CD pipeline that includes:
1. Development environment setup with minimal Node.js configuration
2. Basic testing infrastructure with Jest and React Testing Library
3. Linting with ESLint (light-touch approach)
4. GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
5. Documentation and contribution guidelines

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Development Environment Setup
- [x] Create package.json with development dependencies
- [x] Configure Jest for React component testing
- [x] Set up ESLint with minimal configuration
- [x] Configure Prettier for code formatting
- [x] Add scripts for running tests and linting

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Create Jest configuration
- [x] Set up React Testing Library
- [x] Implement sample tests for Button component
- [x] Configure test coverage reporting
- [x] Set baseline coverage threshold (15-20%)

### 3. Linting Configuration
- [x] Create ESLint configuration with focus on critical errors
- [x] Configure Prettier for code formatting
- [x] Add pre-commit hooks using pre-commit tool (aligned with admin_api pattern)
- [x] Configure hooks for linting, formatting, and testing
- [x] Document linting rules

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow
- [x] Create workflow for running tests and linting
- [x] Configure Node.js environment
- [x] Set up caching for faster CI runs
- [x] Add coverage reporting
- [x] Configure PR comments with test results
- [ ] Verify build passes on correct branch

### 5. Documentation
- [x] Create README.md with component library overview
- [x] Document testing approach
- [x] Create contribution guidelines
- [x] Document CI/CD process
- [ ] Update repository-status.md

## Affected Components
- package.json (new)
- jest.config.js (new)
- .eslintrc.js (new)
- .prettierrc (new)
- .pre-commit-config.yaml (new)
- .github/workflows/test.yml (new)
- tests/ directory (new)
- README.md (updated)
- components/*.js (unchanged)

## Testing Plan
1. Implement basic tests for Button component
2. Verify tests run successfully locally
3. Verify tests run successfully in GitHub Actions
4. Confirm coverage reporting works
5. Ensure linting catches critical errors

## Documentation Impact
- Update project-plan.md with Phase 10 information
- Create phase-10-react-components-cicd documentation
- Update repository-status.md with React Components status
- Create README.md with component library overview

## Dependencies
None. Unlike previous phases, this repository does not use submodules or require external services.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Project plan updated with Phase 10
- [x] Development environment set up with package.json
- [x] Basic tests implemented and passing
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow configured
- [x] Coverage report generated
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] Minimum coverage threshold met (15-20%)
- [ ] Build passing on correct branch
