# Phase 10: React Components CI/CD Implementation [ENG-129]
_Last Updated: 2025-04-03 11:33:12 CDT_

## Overview
Successfully implemented CI/CD pipeline for the React Components repository, establishing proper testing infrastructure and code quality tools. This phase completes the CI/CD implementation across all repositories.

## Key Achievements
- Set up Node.js development environment with Jest and React Testing Library
- Implemented ESLint and Prettier with light-touch approach
- Configured GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Added comprehensive component tests with 50.61% coverage
- Implemented pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Added pre-push hooks for full lint checking

## Technical Approach
- Used Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Implemented SVG mocking for icon components
- Configured ESLint with minimal rules to catch critical issues
- Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Added pre-commit and pre-push hooks using pre-commit tool
- Configured GitHub Actions for Node.js 20.x environment

## Benefits Realized
- Automated testing ensures component reliability
- Code quality tools maintain consistent standards
- Pre-commit hooks catch issues before they reach CI
- Coverage reporting provides visibility into test coverage
- Standardized development environment for all contributors

## Lessons Learned
- SVG imports require proper mocking in Jest tests
- Pre-commit hooks should be configured to run on specific stages
- Light-touch linting approach helps adoption
- Test coverage should focus on critical components first
- Pre-push hooks help catch issues that pre-commit might miss
